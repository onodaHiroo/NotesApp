<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Notes application is a note-taking application built using MVP architecture, Room Database and Kotlin Coroutines. It allows users to create, read, update and delete notes. The application is designed with ease of use and high performance in mind.</p>
<p>As part of my efforts to understand the structure, I wanted to create a sample app and learn from it on my own. It is possible for anyone to copy and utilize all the codes.</p>
